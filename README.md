## Run the App

1) In the command line, open the directory `AngularNativeScript`, and run `npm install`.
2) After the dependencies are installed, run `tns run ios --bundle` for iOS or `tns run android --bundle` for Android
3) To run the web app version, run `ng serve -o` to launch the app. It will be running on `localhost:4200`.
